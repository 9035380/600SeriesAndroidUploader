<p>Direct Nightscout access is now available in a Beta Release Android application! 
This is where you'll find up-to-date information on this evolving Nightscout solution </p>

<a id="the-beta-test-programme-is-now-open" class="anchor" href="#the-beta-test-programme-is-now-open" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Beta test programme is now open</h2>

<p>Please read all of the instructions carefully before deciding whether to proceed with this Beta release.<br>
In order to take part in the programme we ask that you please:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan for the possibility that the application will stop working without warning</li>
<li>Agree to post any issues using &lt;this form&gt;</li>
<li>Keep support queries contained to this submission process during the beta test process so that the developers can efficiently identify issues and focus on getting a full release candidate out to everyone as soon as possible. At times, little / no support will be available through the Facebook Group from the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>This application communicates directly with your 640g pump. It only requests for a status update, using similar techniques used during a CareLink upload, and no safety issues have been found during Alpha testing. However, please ensure that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>monitor pump performance closely whilst using this Beta release of the application and </li>
<li>disable the remote bolus* option on your 640g before using this beta application</li>
<li>use a spare Bayer 2.4 Contour Next Link meter or have an alternative means of measuring blood glucose levels at all times</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>By using this beta release you agree to all of the above.</strong></p>

<p>If you don't feel you have the technical experience or cannot comply with the above conditions, please hang-five and wait for the full production release, which will be along just as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Thanks for waiting patiently<br>

<p>*To disable your 640g's remote bolus feature:<br>
1. Make sure that your pump and compatible Bayer meter are connected.<br>
2. Go to the Remote Bolus screen on the 640g: Menu &gt; Utilities &gt; Remote Bolus<br>
3. Select Remote Bolus to turn the feature off<br>
4. Select Save  </p>
