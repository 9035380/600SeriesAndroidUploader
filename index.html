<p>Medtronic640gUploader (clever project name still being thought up) is a community-led initiative to create an application for uploading data from your Medtronic Minimed 640g to <a href="http://www.nightscout.info/">Nightscout</a>.</p>

<p>While we are working hard for this software to become something usable by the greater 640g community, it is currently in an <em>early development phase</em>.
At this stage we only recommend installing the software if you have a high degree of technical skill that will allow you to diagnose and debug potential problems.</p>

<p>If you do find any issues, please <a href="https://github.com/pazaan/Medtronic640gUploader/issues">search our GitHub issues to see if your issue already exists</a>. If your issue already exists, please add as much usable information that will allow us to diagnose the problem. If your issue does not exist, please create a new one, with as much information as possible that will allow us to reproduce the problem ourselves. 
Though we are quickly building a support community, the primary developer of this software lives in Melbourne, Australia. Chances are high that you will not get an immediate response.</p>

<p>Some issues may require you to learn how to use <a href="http://gitter.im">Gitter</a> so that we can communicate with you directly.</p>
