You can find them, and more information about their excellent insulin pumps [here](https://www.medtronic-diabetes.com.au/pump-therapy/640g)\r\n\r\n### Welcome!\r\nMedtronic640gUploader (clever project name still being thought up) is a community-led initiative to create an application for uploading data from your Medtronic Minimed 640g to [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/).\r\n\r\nWhile we are working hard for this software to become something usable by the greater 640g community, it is currently in an *early development phase*.\r\nAt this stage we only recommend installing the software if you have a high degree of technical skill that will allow you to diagnose and debug potential problems.\r\n\r\nIf you do find any issues, please [search our GitHub issues to see if your issue already exists](https://github.com/pazaan/Medtronic640gUploader/issues). If your issue already exists, please add as much usable information that will allow us to diagnose the problem. If your issue does not exist, please create a new one, with as much information as possible that will allow us to reproduce the problem ourselves. \r\nThough we are quickly building a support community, the primary developer of this software lives in Melbourne, Australia. Chances are high that you will not get an immediate response.\r\n\r\nSome issues may require you to learn how to use [Gitter](http://gitter.im) so that we can communicate with you directly.\r\n",
